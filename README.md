# Mugat2

## About this App

Mugat2 is a two-part application designed to provide a tool for producers in the fashion industry to log the production statuses of styles and interactions with designer clients. 

The React front-end app, which is hosted at `https://erikaannesmith.github.io/capstone/`, hits the Express/Node back-end, which is hosted at `http://es-capstone.herokuapp.com/`.

Iteration 1 is intended to act as a business management tool, while iteration 2 will provide more interactive functionality between authenticated producers and their designer clients, including the ability to create Google Calendar events and invite the associated parties. Additionally, stores styles will have added information including dynamic colors and uploadable images.
